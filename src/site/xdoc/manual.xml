        <section name="Introduction">


            <p>The IDS API provides easy access from Java to a deployed ICAT Data Service (IDS)
                Files may be uploaded, downloaded and deleted from the
                IDS. When a file is uploaded or deleted the action is recorded in ICAT as a new or deleted
                Datafile. ICAT authorization rules are used
                to assign the same rights to access the data as those granted to the metadata.
            </p>



            <p>
                Installation and accessing from maven is explained in
                <a href="installation.html">Java Client Installation.</a>
            </p>

            <subsection name="Setting Up">
                <p>Create an IDSClient instance passing it the URL of the machine providing the service.
                </p>

                <code>
                    URL hostUrl = new URL("https://&lt;hostname&gt;:8181")
                    <br />
                    client = new IdsClient(url);
                </code>

                <p>where &lt;hostname&gt; should be the full name of the IDS server. For a secure installation, just specifying localhost will not
                    work, the name must match what is on the host certificate.
                </p>

            </subsection>


            <subsection name="Using it">
                <p>Most calls to the IDS require an ICAT sessionId so first log in to ICAT to get a sessionId.</p>

                Please consult the
                <a href="apidocs">javadoc</a>
                for a full explanation of what all the calls do.
